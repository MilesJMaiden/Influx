## üöÄ Project Overview

Influx is a top-down, orthographic Unity simulation in which autonomous Agents maintain critical systems while hostile Aliens attempt to sabotage them. Procedurally generated rooms, emergent multi-agent behaviors, and dynamic sabotage threats combine to create endlessly replayable ‚Äúdungeon-style‚Äù environments.

Key systems:
- **Data-Driven Level Generation**  
  Rooms and corridors laid out by a frontier-based algorithm, with NavMesh linking for seamless navigation.
- **Autonomous Agents & FSM**  
  Agents continuously repair Computers, refuel Bins, chase and trap Aliens‚Äîyet can be interrupted by player commands.
- **Hostile Alien AI**  
  Four-state FSM (Seek, Attack, Flee, Wander) drives emergent sabotage gameplay.
- **Interactable Objects**  
  Computers, Bins, RockBins, Tables, Containers‚Äîall managed via a unified `Interactable` base class and coroutines.
- **Robust UI & Controls**  
  Global HUD aggregates system health, unified pause/menu system, and an orthographic camera with panning, zoom, tilt/yaw.
